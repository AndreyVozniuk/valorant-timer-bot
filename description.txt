Before launching Valorant you should start the bot, after that the bot will ask you about the number of hours played in the game, 
if this is the first launch, you should enter your data, for subsequent launches you can enter the information you receive from 
the bot, after the bot will start the stopwatch, when you finish the game you should use the command quit, 
after pressing it the stopwatch will stop and show you information about the time you spent in the game. For any questions 
or suggestions you can write to @AndrushaV.
